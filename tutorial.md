# GLC (Garden Layout Creator) Cheatsheet

Plan, preview, and apply your Magic Garden layout with a visual editor.

## Quick Start

```
Open MagicGarden  ->  GLC launcher appears bottom-right
Click Open / press L  ->  Show Layout Creator window
```

Settings live under the ⚙ button at the top-right of the editor window.

## Default Keybind

```
L   Toggle Layout Creator
```

You can rebind it in Settings (⚙).

## Core Controls (Editor)

```
Left-click     Place selected item
Right-click    Remove item (or clear selection outline)
Click + hold   Paint multiple tiles
Shift + click  Toggle Ignore Zone (purple border)
```

## What You Can Place

- Plants and decor on Dirt tiles (two 10x10 grids).
- Decor only on Boardwalk tiles.
- Mutations on existing plants (Gold, Rainbow, Frozen, Wet, etc.).

## Mutation Mode

```
Select Mutation dropdown
Pick mutation (Gold / Rainbow / Frozen / Chilled / Wet / Dawnlit / Amberlit / ...)
Left-click   Apply mutation
Right-click  Remove mutation only
```

Mutations show color-coded borders and appear separately in Requirements.

## Preview vs Preview ALL

- Preview shows the expected result for about 5 seconds.
- Preview ALL ON shows the full design even if you do not own enough items.

## Requirements Window (Floating)

Shows needed items with owned vs required counts.

- Counts items already placed in your garden that can be moved.
- Highlights missing items in red.

## Applying Layouts (Important)

- Uses Planter Pots.
- Recommended free inventory slots: at least 10.
- Eggs block placement, clear those tiles first.
- If Apply stops early (missing space/items), press Apply again to retry.
- GLC prioritizes moving existing garden items before using inventory items.

## Layout Management

```
Save / Load / Delete layouts
Import / Export JSON (backup + sharing)
Load from garden (copy live layout into editor)
Reset Draft (clear editor)
Invert (mirror current tab)
Clear Left / Clear Right (pots/pickups for that side)
```

## Tile Color Legend

```
Green   Selected tile
Blue    Will be applied
Purple  Ignored tile (not changed)
Yellow  Blocked by egg/obstacle
Red     Missing required items
```

Mutation colors are shown as themed borders (Gold yellow, Rainbow gradient, Frozen icy blue, etc.).

## Tips

- Use Ignore Zones to protect tiles from Apply Layout.
- Keep Preview ALL ON while designing, turn it OFF to see real availability.
- Save often. JSON export is the fastest backup.
